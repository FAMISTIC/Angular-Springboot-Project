- **Database**: (Add your DB here, e.g., MySQL / H2 / PostgreSQL)

## 📚 Features

- Add new server entries
- View a list of servers
- Update server information

- API communication between Angular and Spring Boot

## 🛠️ Installation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse)
2. Configure the database in `application.properties`
3. Run the application:
